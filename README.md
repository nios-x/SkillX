🚀 Introducing SkillX — Learn, Teach & Grow Together! 🎯

I’m excited to share that our team has developed SkillX, a peer-to-peer skill-upgrading platform where learners become teachers and both sides benefit. 💡

🔹 What makes SkillX special?

🎥 Real-time video teaching sessions built on WebRTC, combined with messaging and an interactive canvas where teachers can draw, annotate and guide in-session.

📆 Session requests & scheduling system — learners can request a topic, teachers accept, schedule a time and the call begins.

🏆 Teacher leaderboard & points system — earn points as you teach, climb the ranks and get recognised.

🤖 “Milli AI” — a chatbot integrated to immediately answer common questions and support users.

🎨 A clean, modern UI inspired by Creative Dev design — smooth experience for both students and teachers.

🔧 Tech stack highlights (feel free to adjust if needed):

Front-end: Next.js + Tailwind (or React + …)

Backend: Node.js + Prisma (or whatever you used) + PostgreSQL/MongoDB

Real-time & streaming: WebRTC for video, WebSockets or signaling server for session negotiation.

Chatbot: simple ML/AI model or third-party API.

Hosting: Vercel for front-end, maybe (??) serverless functions or custom server for backend.

🎯 Why we built it
We believe that everyone has something to teach, and by enabling a system where knowledge sharing is rewarded via points and recognition — we foster a community of growth and collaboration. Whether you’re a student wanting to boost your résumé, or someone wanting to share your expertise and earn points — SkillX is for you.
